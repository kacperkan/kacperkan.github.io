## About Me
I am a 4th year PhD Student at Warsaw University of Technology. The PhD
programme is financed by Microsoft Research Cambridge. 

My research revolves around 3D human animation and reconstruction in partial
information and low-shot regime. My interests include computer graphics and
application of machine learning methods in common 3D algorithms.
