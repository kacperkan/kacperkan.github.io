abstract: Despite existing solutions for accurate translation between written and spoken language, sign language is still not well-studied area. A reliable, robust and working in real-time translator of American Sign Language is a crucial bridge to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people. In this paper we propose a method of sign language fingerspelling recognition using a modern architecture of convolutional neural network called Wide Residual Network trained with Snapshot Learning procedure. The model was trained on augmented datasets available at Surrey University and Massey University web pages using transfer learning. The final result is a robust classifier of all alphabet letters, which beats current state-of-the-art results. The outcomes encourage further research in this field for creating fully usable sign language translator.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present a new classification deep learning model for American Sign Language fingerspelling recongition. Our approach relies on multiple, image-phenomena based augmentation methods and modern learning methodology that allowed the model to achieve new state-of-the-art results.
