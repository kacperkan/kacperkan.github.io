When I started PhD at Warsaw University of Technology in Poland, I felt like it
was going to be the best experience in my life. And it already is ... but it's
waaayyy harder to make it pleasant than I have expected (and than everyone has
told me). 

Note before we start: I'm not an expert in doing a proper research (is there a
proper way?), nor I consider myself a succesfull researcher --- I want to try
share my insights that keep me going and I find them helping me. There may be
issues that I haven't met (please, leave them in the comment if we should
discuss them together!) or parts that I'm still doing wrong. Still, I hope that
sharing that stuff will you being a better researcher.

## Finding your PhD thesis topic
<!-- Doodle about finding topic, xkcd -->
The first hurdle that I've met with was selecting a proper topic of my thesis,
that I knew that I could make a significant impact. When I started, I knew that
I wanted to do something with computer graphics combined with machine learning.
Sounds easy then to find something interesting, to do some research in the
field, no? But it was soooo vague! Many of my friends went through the same
stage -- they knew the general field but nothing specific. I started doing an
extensive literature reading, skimming/reading 50 articles a week was a
standard. You may think that's a lot though the number will increase throughout
your PhD -- you'll become more efficient in reading, you'll develop your own way
of reading scientific papers, you'll find the pattern that will enable you
understanding many parts by just looking at figures or equations.

Reading more and more papers got me a sense of what the field is about. Once I
noticed that, I started getting into details of most relevant papers to identify
potentatial problems. Some of these papers had interesting `Future Works`
section -- note however that it may be a trap which will make you follow the
narrative of the paper and leaves you small field to manuever regarding novelty
of your method.

At this point, I was almost decided of what I want to work on and how my
research question should look like. But ... I was afraid of actually doing that:
what if the topic is not relevant or will make me bored? I felt stall and didn't
do much for the next week. I started writing e-mails to the first authors of
papers that I was interested in the most. I set up multiple calls, had multiple
conversations. One call with one of these guys, Lukas, was particular -- we
started looking closer at some of these papers on a shared screen and he started
talking about potential ideas. He was in the flow of his thoughts of all the
problems that were apparent to him but weren't visible in my sight, mostly
because of the lack of experience. The sentence that resonated with the most was
"Yeah, that particular problem is relevant I'd love to see the solution to it".
I got my wings that I could fly with, I was super motivated and almost
immediately started working on it once I informed about my supervisor about the
idea.

What is the conclusion of the story? The research should not be a small, closed
world of a PhD student. In the worst case, I would have ended up with a topic
that is irrelevant to literally everyone. There're just too many interesting
topics and researchers will just want to share their experience with motivated
people -- get in touch these guys if you want to do something great.


**Tip:** Give yourself time ... Start slowly, read through the papers, find the 
topic that will interest you, talk to people (especially other researchers and
potential stakeholders). Don't limit yourself to your own closed ring of people
you know. Write e-mails to first authors of papers that you find interesting,
express your enthusiasm towards doing research. At the same time change your
mindset towards being goal- and action-oriented! That's something that, from my
experience, is not expressed enough at universities.  

**Exceptions:** People who are already participating in a specific scientific
project where the topic is specified or their supervisor gave them a proposal
that they may work on. Though, it also depends on the project's size -- the
bigger the project, the more flexible your PhD may be. 

**Caveat:** This is the step where you can get stuck quite quickly and start
asking questions: what subject will make me interested in it, what are the
problems to solve there, how can I understand that field, and, most importantly,
how to specify my topic?



## Feeling stale
<!-- bored person, scrolling through the paper -->
Oh, so you've already found your PhD thesis that you're going to devote some
part of your life? That's great than! It's of the first obstacles that you have
to overcome. While specifying the topic settles you down a little bit, there's
more problems waiting for you. We shall start with: ok, so I should start
writing a paper now, shouldn't I? But what topic? What problem exactly?

I've been there and felt into a common trap. 1) I've tried to firstly find a
problem that I'd like work on. 2) Then I started working on it BUT I had many
stale moments when I could spend a whole week thinking about how to approach the
problem. 3) Finally, I've attached myself to that problem to the point that I
wanted to deliver almost anything to the nearest deadline, no matter the cost.

I want to say something about these points and how to avoid being in a similar
situation. While thinking sometimes about the problems to solve and how to solve
is a good thing, there's a limited time you really want to spend during the
day. At some point, there's no sense to push further yourself and wish for the
best that an idea will come from nowhere.

1) As a starting PhD student, you have a vague idea what's going on in the
   field, if you've never worked in it. This may lead to potential problems such
   as spending too much time on finding a problem to solve, finding a problem
   that at first glance solvable but in reality it's not, or finding a problem
   is solved or is not important. Each of these cause an anxiety that follows
   you all the time until you get your paper published (though I could feel that
   even after that).

   **Tip:** Consult the stuff with people who already familiar with the field.
   Sometimes authors don't write in their papers that some kind of a method is a
   dead end and they shouldn't be followed. These conclusions come by the end of
   the project when everything necessary is already done and yet the project has
   to be finished with a written paper ([*publish or
   perish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish) anyone?).
   Mentioning such a problem in the paper would guarantee the rejection in the
   journal/at the conference. What helped me definitely, was setting up a
   meeting with two polish guys from DeepMind and University of Edinburgh. We
   spend a lot of time discussing what can be done. During one of such meetings
   we realized that there's a serious limitation in reconstructing 3D objects
   with existing machine learning methods. The realization led me to working on
   [my first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09102). 

   In summary: talk to more senior researchers. To make the contact more
   probable write short, direct mails to first authors of the papers (in machine
   learning, the authors are sorted by their subjective contribution to the
   paper).

2) You have a limited experience regarding the topic. You have probably worked
   on something unrelated for your Bachelor/Master thesis. Approaching new
   method, new problem takes your time. You read papers to get inspired.
   Sometimes you read them for weeks and you don't code or prepare any
   experiments. Understandable but this cycle and hope for getting suddenly
   better will just increase your anxiety. Especially if your days become
   similar to each other (*i.e.* sitting all day in the lab, having done
   nothing, getting back home miserable and repeating these activities for the
   next days).

   **Tip:** Take literally any action that may help get you inspired and doesn't
   make sit in front of you computer the whole day. This includes talking to
   your supervisor, postdoc in your lab, other PhD students working in a similar
   topic or, again, cold mailing other research from faimiliar papers.

   My biggest realizations and sudden progress moments in the research were
   during active brainstorming sessions with my only one of my collaborators (so
   I could have 4 brainstorming sessions in a single week). Making a single
   meeting with all your collaborators is good if you want to give an update and
   consult further steps in your research. However, the power of brainstorming
   quickly disipates with any additional person during the meeting. Limit
   yourself to individual meetings and have one meeting with as many
   collaborators as possible.

3) The final thing is a bit of a trap -- you've found your topic and problem to
   solve, you've settled that you want to work on that for the next article and
   the deadline is approaching. But wait, you've learned so much since you've
   started, you have glimpses of thoughts "wow, this field is broken",
   "solving this problem is not impactful and important to me" or "I don't enjoy
   it anymore". All of them make you to rethink whether you should quit the
   topic and start something anew. "But I've done so much already!" stops you
   from doing that. 
   
   **Tip:** That's when talking with senior researchers comes into play (again).
   It's rather the matter of taste and personal experience -- some projects are
   better to be delivered. Especially that you, as a PhD student, have to show
   yourself as a good researcher that can discover and invent. However, if you
   decide to quit the project, don't look back as it can cause a feeling of
   regret of thoughts starting with "what if ...". Focus and push the next
   project.

<!-- chatting with people -->

Beside the things above, there's also one thing that stopped me ... I was to
ambitious. This led me to coming up with methods that were badly motivated, not
founded in a specific domain insight. I spent a lot of time debugging, fixing
these methods and time was passing constantly. While being ambitious is not a
bad thing, you have to work out your own method in approaching complex problems.
In machine learning field, it often boils down to steps (note, they're not
universal and I adapt it to a specific problem):
1. Reimplement or use an existing implementation of a method. Remove components
   that you are sure will be not necessary.
2. Create a toy data where this method breaks in an obvious way. You really want
   to evaluate your method as quickly as possible.
3. Start adding components, one by one. After each experiment, you really want
   to write down insights and save the results. 
4. Why saving the results you say? Some of these components can bring negligible
   improvement but when working in tandem, they solve your problem.

Ok ok, but that fits the machine learning field, right? How about architecture,
engineering and other fields? I'd rewrite the steps above as:
1. Once you have your problem, identify limitations of existing approaches to
   solve that problem. Is it a type of construction designed in such a way so
   that warmth is disipated more uniformly across the building? Is the solar
   panel supposed to be efficient? Can you improve on these results?
2. Make a toy model or scaled down method/construct proposed in related works.
   Check if your hypothesis is valid about their limitation.
3. Make a toy model or scaled down version of your solution. Given the same
   conditions, is your approach better the others?
4. Sometimes, if it's feasible costwise, you may want to create a new model from
   scratch, adding new component so you have a direct comparison between the
   current and the previous iteration.

However note, that your field can a different characteristic and you may want to
consult these tips with your supervisor or any other senior researcher in the
field.

**Tip:** Start as easy as possible. Boil down the problem and method to the
least degrees of freedom. Then, build on that framework to solve to problem.
What still resonates in my head, are two sentences: "What is the problem?" and
"Can you make it simpler?" -- you can find these two [How to Solve It by George
Polya](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691164076/how-to-solve-it).
The book has "A new aspect of mathematical method" in the subtitle, though in my
opinion the approach in the book is universal.

**Exceptions:** There are actually no exceptions -- tips given above apply in my
opinion to any profession, any major and any stage of your research life. 

**Caveat:** The story applies mostly to the cases where you want to write your
PhD topic upon published papers. Note, that it's not required for all fields
where a single thesis may be enough. These paragraphs above are mostly from the
perspective of a PhD student in Machine Learning, where the field is
competetive, changes quickly and a lot of stuff happens in a single year --
you really want to leave a scientific trace sooner than later in such a case.

{{< figure src="assets/the-illustrated-guide-to-a-phd.jpg" caption="You can be lucky in you life and change the entire field. However, in most cases it's relevant that you can push the boundary of the current knowledge of the entire humanity" numbered="False" >}}



## PhD is not the only thing in your life
Many PhD students end up quitting their research adventure for different
reasons. From my view, there's one trap that may bring you to such a decision --
expecting that doing a research will bring you happinness, success and fame.
Guess what, it's rare. At the start of my PhD, I wanted to rush. I wanted to
publish as many papers as possible once I set my thesis topic. I wanted to
finish my PhD sooner than later and focus on other aspects of life. To be
focused to such a degree, I spend a lot of time, sometimes working 16 hours a
day for a prolonged period of time (but I wouldn't say that these 16 hours were
well spent)...

However, it has never happened -- I'm still doing my PhD and I'm grateful for
that. I started balancing my life between hobbies, people I love spending time
with and personal development, going outside more. During the pandemic time, I
needed that. While I still do crunching just before the deadlines, I compensate
for that after the deadline and take care of parts of my life that I've
abandoned for that short period of time.

Unforunately, the PhD adventure is more of ups and downs than a steady walk.
There are more failures than successes. When you look at other researchers, you
only see their success. Nobody counts the number of failures, and bad ideas that
they had to get through. Sometimes, a researcher comes popular out of nowhere
with a single paper, while they're in their 40s but they've done their PhD in
20s. You don't know what that person had to come through during this period.
Take easy on yourself, your PhD life is your story that you have to write. At
the same time, you won't to write a book that is a copy of any others.


**Tip:** Don't let your hobby down, sometimes it's the thing that will push you
forward in the most dark times (who has never been in a flow state?). Don't quit
contacting your family and friends on regular basis, these are the people who
you can rely on when it becomes really bad.

**Exceptions:** People who are already aware of the problems coming with
focusing too much on your PhD. Thanks to them have I learned how to deal with a
daily life, more downs than ups, and how to act upon bad days.

## I'm not doing PhD, does it relate to me?
A bit ...Going from full-time job to PhD hit me personally at the very
beginning. There was no specific goal when I started, a lot of bearocracy to
overcome. Yet, doing PhD requires from you a specific mindset --- a mindset of
researcher and a person who has to take an iniciative. It learns you that every
second plays a role (especially that you don't get money from that by default)
--- you don't create a content, or learn anything new, you lose your life. This 
mindset allows me approach any new project differently than ever before. Having
this mindset may improve your current project as well by improving your
insightfullness about the problem you're trying to solve, or your approach in
general to the problem itself. That's why I started PhD --- one of my workmates
inspired by his unique attitude towards a project in our startup. I hope that
even if you don't plan to start PhD, you'll still get inspired by some of these
folks and learn as much as possible from them.



## Final Words
When I got to writing this section, I started realizing that I've mentioned a
lot "talking" tips. When you think about it, it may be actually the case and
also explain why many succesful resesearchers also have vast network connections
to any other researcher. These guys, while being often smart, don't wait until
the idea will come of nowhere -- they often pitch their ideas to others, expect
fine-grained critique, rebuild their hypothesis upon these insights. Only
when the problem definition and the idea are "good enough" do they start working
towards their goal.

Sounds more like a collective research and not individual one, huh? This is my
insight from doing PhD so far -- don't expect you'll change the world or publish
anything impactful completely alone. Expect, that there's always someone more
experienced than you that is willing to help you in becoming a better
researcher.
